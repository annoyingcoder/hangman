# hangman
My first python game(Hangman)

What is hangman? How to play?
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

This was my first python game ever!
